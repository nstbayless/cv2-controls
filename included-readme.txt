#### Castlevania II Improved Controls ####

This hack modernizes the control scheme of Castlevania 2 to make it less frustrating to people
used to tighter controls as in Symphony of the Night and Mega Man. It primarily allows the player
greater control while jumping and on stairs.

################ Changes #################

Complete list of changes:

    Enables the player to control their x-velocity in mid-air while jumping (including while jump-attacking).
    When releasing the jump button, Simon immediately starts falling again; this allows the player to
	    make smaller hops if desired.
    After being knocked back, the player regains control after a split second and can angle their fall.
    When walking off an edge, the player retains control instead of dropping straight down.
    The player can jump off of stairs at any point in the climb. (However, it is still impossible to land
	    on stairs, so be careful jumping from long flights of stairs over pits.)
    If the player is struck by an enemy while climbing stairs, they will not be knocked off the stairs. This
	    is the same as the behaviour in Castlevania 1 and 3.
    Simon blinks rapidly after getting hit, as in Castlevania 1 and 3.
