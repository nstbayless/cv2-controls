## Function notation

// indicates a comment

  // X might always be 12 here.

.. indicates description (of what code is doing / of control flow)

  .. handle xspeed

to indicate register signatures, a lower case means ignored/overwritten, upper case means used meaningfully, * means uncertain. Order is always AXY. | means unaffected. Example:

1.    subroutine ? AXy:Axy
2.	  check tile A**:*Xy
3.    check NPC Axy:ay |X
4.    subroutine ? axY: |AXY
  
1. This soubroutine takes A and X as arguments and returns a value in A.
2. This subroutine takes A as an argument (and possibly XY as well) and returns X. The return value of A is possibly meaningful but the return value of Y is not.
3. This subroutine takes only A as an argument, returns nothing, and X is ignored.
4. This subroutine returns all registers as they were, but the value of Y is meaningful as input. This syntax can be abbreviated as axY|AXY
